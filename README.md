# Day 2 - HTML Basic Website Structure

This project includes the HTML files created during Day 2 of my HTML learning journey. The goal was to build a multi-page static website with internal navigation, media, and embedded content.

## 🌐 Pages Included

- **index.html** (Home Page)
- **about.html**
- **contact.html**
- **privacy.html**

## 🔧 Key Features

- Internal navigation using anchor tags (`<a href>`)
- Embedded content using:
  - `<iframe>` (Wikipedia, Google Maps, YouTube)
  - `<audio>` and `<video>` for media playback
- Usage of formatting tags (`<u>`, `<b>`, `<em>`, etc.)
- Responsive layout using `<meta viewport>`

## 🎯 Purpose

To understand and apply basic HTML structure, multimedia tags, and linking between web pages to simulate a real-world site layout.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use the navigation bar to explore the site.
